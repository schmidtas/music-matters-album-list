# Music Matters - LPs Stock [WIP]

Small project to read Music Matters Google Sheet with available LPs and displays in a more readable table with filtering option.\
**Note:** this project is still WIP, so maybe not everything will be working, code is not optimized in any way and UI will look terrible!

## Development

This project uses `create-react-app`, so below commands are available:

* `yarn`: Install the project for local development;
* `yarn start`: Runs the app in the development mode;
* `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode [future work];
* `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder;
